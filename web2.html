    <h2>How to make Mousse Cake</h2>
    <p>Simplified Chocolate Mousse <br>
        The chocolate mousse adds a creamy and light contrast to the dark chocolate layers. You need 6 ingredients: <br>

        1.Hot Water <br>
        2.Cocoa Powder – natural or dutch-process <br>
        3.Melted Chocolate – use two 4-ounce chocolate baking bars found in the baking aisle <br>
        4.Heavy Cream <br>
        5.Confectioners’ Sugar <br>
        6.Vanilla Extract <br>
        Whisk the hot water and cocoa powder together. Pour into melted chocolate. The hot water breaks up the
        chocolate, adding to the airy mousse consistency. Cocoa powder creates additional chocolate flavor. Fold this
        chocolate mixture into whipped cream– a combination of heavy cream, confectioners’ sugar, and vanilla extract.
        Baker’s Tip: The chocolate mousse must chill in the refrigerator before using, so it’s a good idea to make it
        ahead of time or as the chocolate cake layers are cooling. The mousse is best cold, so I actually recommend
        serving the cake cold. (Additionally, the cake is much easier to assemble if the mousse is cold!)

    <h2>How to make Panna Cotta</h2>
    <p>1.Off the heat, place 1 cup milk in a medium sauce pan and sprinkle the top with 1 packet gelatin. Let stand 3-5
        min or until gelatin is softened. Place pan over medium/low heat and stir until gelatin dissolves and mixture is
        steaming, about 4-5 min (do not boil). <br>
        2.Add 2 cups heavy whipping cream, 1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt. Continue stirring
        about 5 min until sugar is fully dissolved and mixture is steaming (do not boil). Remove from heat and let cool
        5 minutes. <br>
        3.Place sour cream in a medium bowl with a pouring lip. Whisking constantly, gradually add warm cream. Once the
        mixture is completely smooth, divide it into 6 wine glasses or 8 ramekins. Refrigerate until fully set; 4 to 6
        hours. <br>
    </p>
    <p>&#42; How to make Berry Sauce in Panna Cotta <br>
        1.In a small sauce pan, combine 1 cup berries, 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice and 3 Tbsp sugar. Bring to a low boil and
        cook 4-5 min or until syrupy. <br>
        2.Stir in remaining 1 cup of fresh berries and remove from heat. When syrup is at room temp or just barely warm,
        spoon it over the top of chilled panna cottas. <br>

    <h2>How to make Tiramisu</h2>
    <p>1.Whisk espresso and Grand Marnier. Grand Marnier makes this a boozier tiramisu because there is alcohol in both
        the coffee mixture and the mascarpone cream. Grand Marnier’s flavor is great in this dessert, but you can skip
        it if desired. If you don’t have espresso, purchase espresso powder and follow the measurements in the recipe
        notes. <br>
        2.Dip half of the ladyfingers in the espresso mixture. Ladyfingers soak up a lot of liquid within 1 second, so
        make it a very quick dunk. You don’t want them overly saturated and soggy because as the tiramisu chills,
        they’ll soften up underneath all the cream. <br>
        3.Line dipped ladyfingers in bottom of pan. Arrange dipped ladyfingers in the baking pan to make one solid
        layer. If needed, cut some ladyfingers to fill in any empty spaces. <br>
        4.Beat mascarpone and rum together. Use quality mascarpone. I like BelGioioso brand (not sponsored– truly what I
        always use). Though this is primarily an espresso-flavored dessert, tiramisu has rum as well. <br>
        5.Gently cook egg yolks and sugar. Egg yolks are a main ingredient in tiramisu. Use a double boiler or makeshift
        bowl/saucepan double boiler to cook egg yolks and sugar together. Maida’s recipe also uses the egg whites, which
        come soon after this step. <br>
        6.Beat egg yolks into mascarpone cream mixture. <br>
        7.Make whipped cream. Whip heavy cream and vanilla extract into medium peaks. <br>
        8.Fold whipped cream into mascarpone cream mixture. <br>
        9.Whip egg whites, salt, and sugar. Beat the egg whites and salt together until foamy, then slowly pour in sugar
        and beat until stiff peaks form. <br>
        10.Fold egg white mixture into mascarpone cream mixture. <br>
        11.Layer half of the cream mixture on top of the ladyfingers. An offset spatula helps. <br>
        12.Dip and layer remaining ladyfingers. <br>
        13.Top with remaining cream mixture, then chill for for 2-3 hours. <br>
        14.Dust with cocoa. After chilling for a couple hours, dust the top layer with a dense layer of unsweetened
        cocoa powder. Use a sifter. This is a classic finishing touch to the entire tiramisu dessert. <br>
        15.Chill overnight. You can chill it for up to 1 day, so it’s a great make-ahead dessert recipe! <br>
